# AI Engineer Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey along the [AI Engineer path](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/ai-engineer).  
It serves as a structured knowledge base where I consolidate concepts, exercises, notes, and reflections while progressing through formal training.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Track my progress in AI engineering fundamentals
- Reinforce learning through written explanations and implementation
- Document key concepts in Machine Learning, NLP, and Generative AI
- Store solutions to exercises and personal annotations
- Build a long-term technical knowledge reference

This repository is **not** intended to redistribute course material. It exists purely as a personal learning tracker and knowledge consolidation space.
